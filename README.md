This area in the repo is a result of the blog post [Applying NLP in Java, all from the command-line](https://medium.com/@neomatrix369/applying-nlp-in-java-all-from-the-command-line-1225dd591e80) | [Original post](https://valohai.com/blog/nlp_with_dl4j_in_java_all_from_the_command-line?from=3oxenia9mtr6). Please refer to the post before considering using this repo to understand better on how to use the different aspects of it.

---

Open built-in Terminal from the IntelliJ IDEA. 
If you prefer, use the terminal app on your computer.
In the terminal window, `cd` to the project root directory `dl4j-nlp-cuda-example` if not already in.
(_you can use IDE's run-configuration green run button, if you like._)

### Quick startup

- open an account on [https://valohai.com](), see [https://app.valohai.com/accounts/signup/]()
- [install Valohai CLI](https://docs.valohai.com/tutorials/quick-start-cli.html?highlight=cli) on your local machine
- clone _this repo (https://github.com/.../dl4j-nlp-cuda-example/)_
```bash
    $ git clone [url to this repo]
    $ cd dl4j-nlp-cuda-example
```
- create a Valohai project using the [Valohai CLI](https://docs.valohai.com/tutorials/quick-start-cli.html?highlight=cli) tool, and give it a name
```bash
    $ vh project create
```
- link your Valohai project with the _url to this github repo_ on the Repository tab of the Settings page (https://app.valohai.com/p/[your-user-id]/dl4j-nlp-cuda-example/settings/repository/)
```bash
    $ vh project open
    
    ### Go to the Settings page > Repository tab and update the git repo address with this git repo: https://github.com/.../dl4j-nlp-cuda-example/
```
- update Valohai project with the latest commits from the git repo
```bash
    $ vh project fetch
```

And you are ready to start using the power of performing Machine Learning tasks from the command-line.

### Advanced installation and setup

To be able to run the apps and tasks we will cover in this project on your local machine (in addition to using the Valohai platform) we would need to have the below installed and configured on your local machine (how to do each one of these are outside the scope of the project, although links to resources are provided):

**_Build and run app on local machine_**
- Git
- Python 2.7 or Python 3.4 or higher
- GraalVM CE 19.2.1 or higher (download from [https://github.com/oracle/graal/releases]())
- Maven 3.6.0 or higher

**_Build and run app inside a docker container_**
- Docker CE 19.03.2 or higher

**_Do the above and make use of GPUs - CUDA, cuDNN, etc._**
- Nvidia, CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN (7.0) drivers version (Linux and Windows machines only, support for MacOS is unavailable) (see [Resources](#resoures) at the bottom of this post for download and installation [details on GPUs, CUDA, cuDNN, etc...](./docs/gpu-related-resources.md))

#### Valohai CLI installation and Valohai project setup

See [Valohai CLI installation and Valohai project setup](./docs/valohai-setup.md)

#### Build the app using the Valohai platform

See [Build the app using the Valohai platform](./docs/valohai-build-app.md)

#### Gathering Nvidia GPU, Nvidia drivers, CUDA details

```bash
$ vh exec run know-your-gpus
```

Will run a bunch of commands to gather Nvidia GPU, Nvidia drivers, CUDA details on a machine, this step is also used by other steps. The captured result is stored in a log file and archive after each run. See [GPU related resources](./docs/gpu-related-resources.md)

#### Build the app on the local machine

##### CPU version

```bash
$ BACKEND=cpu ./buildUberJar.sh
```

##### GPU version

**Note:** please ensure you have access to an Nvidia GPU and the necessary drivers i.e. CUDA, cuDNN etc... are installed, see [GPU related resources](./docs/gpu-related-resources.md).

```bash
$ BACKEND=gpu ./buildUberJar.sh
```

#### Run the app on the local machine

See [Run the app on the local machine](./docs/running-local-machine.md)

#### Building the docker container to run CUDA-enabled Java apps

See [Building the docker container to run CUDA-enabled Java apps](./docs/docker-cuda-app.md)

#### Run app in docker container

```bash
$ cd dl4j-nlp-cuda-example/docker
$ ./docker-runner --runContainer   ### neomatrix369 or DOCKER_USER_NAME is set to your Docker Hub username 

or

$ ./docker-runner --dockerUserName [neomatrix369 or your Docker Hub username] \
                  --runContainer
```

At the prompt in the container, do the same as mentioned in section [Run app on your local machine](#run-app-on-the-local-machine).

You would use your Docker Hub username only when you have an Docker image with your username available locally or on Docker Hub.

### Running other examples on the local machine
